Voron Nevermore <BR>
What the raven is the Nevermore? Its another recirculation carbon filter design aimed at cleaning the VOCs produced by the printer again and again and again, instead of using a one-pass exhaust of ever decreasing efficiency. The name comes from "Nevermore", the only, and repeatedly spoken, word by the Raven/Voron in the famous Edgar Allan Poe poem. 
I'd like to think the whole poem is about the importance of great air cleaning capacity.

Why?
At the end of the day, a fresh single-pass filtered exhaust (at brand new) has perhaps 70% VOC removal efficiency while still exhausting 30% of the nasty. A recirculation filter achieving four passes at worn-in 50% efficiency would still remove 94% of the bas stuff. Or 99% at six passes! The number of passes you get all depends on how well you can seal your build chamber.
Some will have a hard time achieving a good chamber seal, which creates the biggest drawback of recirculation filters - they're air flow neutral. Meaning, as nothing pulls air into the chamber, air can diffuse freely to the outside through any remaining gaps. And that air could be zero per cent cleaned... 
So, only good in theory?
To remedy the boon of negative pressure, the Nevermore incorporates a small exhaust fan, that is used to keep a slight negative pressure inside the chamber - air will still just get pulled _into_ the chamber through any remaning cracks, not leak outside. Dont ramp it up high! Its meant to just barely evict air - so that the majority of air flow through the filter is still recirculated. The exhaust can also be used to keep the chamber at a set temperature in MainSails. 
Air evicted through the exhaust will at least have passed through the carbon filter, pre-filter and HEPA filter at least once (hopefully many more times) - so its a good security measure to have if you dont want to bet on if your chamber is hermetically sealed.
Okay, but there's a filtered exhaust already?
Yup, but aside from being one-pass, regular mesh carbon filters mainly consists of...mesh. And active carbon sprinkle - miniscule amounts. They're not meant to be used 24/7 in a 3d printer, as continuous air flow depletes carbon binding capacity. Its not that the carbon select just to bind toxic stuff, just running regular household air through a mesh filter will still depete it in weeks. Keeping a carbon filter exposed to air depletes the filter too. Friggin everything depletes carbon filters. But if you change the filters every week and are okay with limited filtering capacity, the standard stuff is good too!
The Nevermore has more than a kilo, or two pounds, of active carbon. Not single-digit grams. And its sealed off from the surroundings; when its not running, its not depleting. And when is does run, it has alot of VOC binding capacity! About five hundred times more. This is the filter for the low maintenence crowd, who still want to be safe.
 
I’VE WORKED WITH PLASTICS ALL MY LIFE, THE DANGERS ARE WAY OVERRATED!
If you live alone - not impacting other people – and feel that way, this filter is not for you! After all, you’re perfectly allowed to smoke two packs a day or become a opposition politician in Russia too, even though it’s probably not optimal for your health. And on an individual level one can never be sure what the health effects will be, if any - the oldest person ever used to smoke until she was 118 years or so…

But speaking of what we do know, we can say for sure that:
• The WHO:s International Agency for Research of Cancer (IARC) classifies chemical compounds based on the known evidence of human carcinogenics, into four classes (carcinogenic, probably carcinogenic, possibly carcinogenic or not classifiable as carcinogenic to humans). Most chemicals fall into the last category, but in the known carcinogenic groups we find several known 3d printer byproducts:
o Benzene.
One of the main fumes from ABS printing. 3ppm regarded as safe, whereas up to 280 ppm of VOCs are produced ABS printing every hour in a small space. Proven to cause different leukemias, and suspected of causing a multitude of other cancers. Female workers in a shoe factory exposed to 40ppm for a long time had a hundredfold higher risk of dying from breast cancer, for instance. Class 1 carcinogenic.
o Styrene
Main pollutant in ABS fumes, recently upgraded from possible to probable carcinogenic based on mounting evidence of connection with a close to tripled risk of different leukemias.
o Butadiene
Another component of ABS printing, and the reason why styrene didn’t get the carcinogenic label for so long (as both are ABS byproducts it was long impossible to know if a cancer type was due to butadiene or styrene. Butadiene is also a known cause and/or cofactor in cardiovascular disease, so you might get your heart attack or stroke a few years earlier by breathing it in for a long time.
Other knowns:
• What creates the most particles/VOCs from plastics handling is heated extrusion.
• Injection molding, vacuum forming and other common industrial methods creates less air pollutants due to less melted plastic surface per kg with direct air/oxygen access/airflow.
• 3D printing extrusion takes this to another VOC creation level, as you’re extruding thin layer by thin layer, not trapping any of the extruded melted material from access to oxygen or airflow. Thus, per kilogram of product, it’s the most particle and VOC generating plastic process there is.
• Home 3d printers are often used in places without industrial ventilation or industrial wet scrubbing. Indeed, a recent study showed that levels of VOC carcinogenics in plastics recycling plants using heated extrusion processes were mostly within safe limits. However, in surrounding residential homes of those safe-to-work plants, VOC levels were up to 42 times the safe limits and consisted of the ventilated byproducts from the plastic plants, due to lower ventilation requirements in homes. The study showed a clear increased lifetime cancer risk, even for the workers of the plants.

This is a short list of some key knowns, and only address the most common ABS fumes. Other materials have different VOCs. PETG for instance, releases Toluene, Acetaldehyde, Formaldehyde – all of which are known health hazards. Regular PLA and Nylons without additives are usually safer, with release of lower levels of acetone, methyl-methacrylate, and iso-butanol (PLA) and Propylene Glycol and Cyclopentanone (Nylon). Not all fumes are created equal.
