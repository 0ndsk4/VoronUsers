    But the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only<BR>
That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.<br>
    Nothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered—<BR>
    Till I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown before—<br>
On the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.”<BR>

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Nevermore

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

What the raven is the Nevermore? Its another recirculation carbon filter design aimed at cleaning the VOCs produced by the printer REPEATEDLY, instead of using a one-pass exhaust of ever decreasing efficiency. Being the fourth filter design in my filter ventures, I feel this is the best blend of looks, simplicity and pure filtration power yet - all while managing a balanced noise level.

<B>Why:</b><BR>
At the end of the day, a fresh single-pass filtered exhaust (at brand new) has perhaps 70% VOC removal efficiency while still exhausting 30% of the nasty. A recirculation filter achieving four passes at worn-in 50% efficiency would still remove 94% of the bas stuff. Or 99% at six passes! The number of passes you get all depends on how well you can seal your build chamber.
Some will have a hard time achieving a good chamber seal, which creates the biggest drawback of recirculation filters - they're air flow neutral. Meaning, as nothing pulls air into the chamber, air can diffuse freely to the outside through any remaining gaps. And that air could be zero per cent cleaned... 


Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have have contributed to expanding this template!
