# einsy + ramps combo

This is my custom klipper config, but be careful with the screen config, you will most likely need to change it as I'm not using a standard display.
Caution! I use LV8729 drivers for my Z axis, they have inverted enable (EN) pins, you have to reomve the "!" from if you are using different drivers like A4988, DRVs or TMCs.
I added control via the display menu for my custom LED lighting as well.
You will need to rename the config to "printer.cfg"
